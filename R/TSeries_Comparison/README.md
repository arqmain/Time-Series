# DATA SCIENCE: A COMPARISON OF MODELS TO FORECAST TIME SERIES WITH R

<br>

This project deals with a comparison of eight models applied to a time series (TS) "dataset". The data analysis, as well as the modeling process, are both developed by using R.

The general objective here is to explore and forecast the dataset by fitting four models and selecting the best one among them.

The specific objectives of this project are:

* Present a usual way of describing a TS to obtain a quick overview of its initial structure.
* Generate models for TS obtaining measurements of its goodness of fit.
* Deliver appropriate graphics so that they can visualize the models both individually and jointly.
* Submit a way to compare and select TS models
* Present and analyze the structure of the selected model.
